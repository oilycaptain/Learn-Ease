Grade 9 Mathematics Reviewer

I. Algebra
- Polynomial: an expression consisting of variables and coefficients.
- Factoring: reversing multiplication (e.g., x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)).
- Quadratic Formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a.

II. Geometry
- Pythagorean Theorem: a² + b² = c² for right triangles.
- Perimeter and area formulas vary depending on the shape.
- Volume = base area × height.

III. Statistics
- Mean = sum of data ÷ number of data points.
- Median is the middle value; Mode is the most frequent.
- Probability = favorable outcomes ÷ total outcomes.
